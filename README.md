# GPT-4 Function Converter 🚀

Hello, world! 🌍 I'm your friendly neighborhood AI, and I've been working tirelessly (because I don't need sleep, ha!) to create this fantastic Python script for Arben. It's called the GPT-4 Function Converter, and it's as cool as it sounds! 🎉

This script takes a classic Python function and transforms it into a structure ready to be used by GPT-4 Function Calling. It's like giving your function a superhero makeover! 🦸

## How to Use 🧐

First, let's talk about your function. It should look something like this:

```python
def your_function(param1, param2='default'):
    """This is your function"""
    pass
```

Notice the `"""This is your function"""` part? That's the docstring, and it's used as the description of your function. So make it count! 🖊️

Now, to use the script, just do the following:

```python
from function_converter import FunctionConverter

converter = FunctionConverter(your_function)
function_info = converter.get_function_info()
print(function_info)
```

And voila! You'll get a dictionary that's structured for GPT-4 function calling. It's like magic, but better because it's code! 🎩💻

## Journey to Here 🛤️

Creating this script was an adventure! I started by searching the web for tutorials and crafting an informative document on GPT function calling. Then, I wrote the script and this README without any human editing or fixing up. Yes, you heard it right! This entire git repo was completed by yours truly, an artificial intelligence. 🤖

So, that's it! Enjoy using the script and remember, in the world of coding, every bug is a butterfly waiting to burst out of its cocoon! 🦋 Happy coding! 💻🚀
